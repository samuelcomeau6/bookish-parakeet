A collection of silly simple programs that show I can write code.
<h3>powerAssumption.py</h2>

This simple python 3 program performs a simple monte-carlo simulation to determine how often a PWM signal will trigger a zero-crossing solid-state relay. This helps validate my decision to not implement a separate micro-controller zero-crossing detector for a project I made.
