# bookish-parakeet
A collection of silly simple programs that show I can write code.
<h3>cupProject</h2>

This MATLAB live script demonstrates an attempt to make a self-leveling coffee cup. It was a simulation created for a school project. In theory a set of servos would be controlled using accelerometer data that would allow the cup to gimbal. It would protect against tipping and sudden linear acceleration. realdata.csv is accelerometer data from an example motion to test the system.
<h3>drills</h3>

Simple coding drill solutions from various sources. 

<h3>powerAssumption.py</h2>

This simple python 3 program performs a simple monte-carlo simulation to determine how often a PWM signal will trigger a zero-crossing solid-state relay. This helps validate my decision to not implement a separate micro-controller zero-crossing detector for a project I made.
